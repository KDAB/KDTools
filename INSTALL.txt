This describes how to compile KD Tools from source on Unix:

1) Configure the library
   
   Make sure, that the qmake executable can be found in the path. Otherwise,
   set QTDIR by doing:
   export QTDIR=/path/to/qt

   Run the configure script:
   ./configure.sh

   If you want KD Tools installed in a non-default localtion, add:
   -prefix /path/to/kdtools (defaults to /usr/local/KDAB/KDTools-<version>)

   To install the plugins in a non-default location, add:
   -plugins-prefix /path/to/plugins (defaults to $QTDIR/plugins)

   If you want your library to contain debug symbols, add:
   -debug

   To compile KD Tools as static library, add:
   -static

   Other options can be seen with ./configure.sh -h

2) Setup LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the lib directory.
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdtools/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line instead:
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdtools/lib
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   Setup QMAKEFEATURES to point to the KD Tools features file:
   QMAKEFEATURES=/path/to/kdtools/mkspecs/features:$QMAKEFEATURES

   If you do not have QMAKEFEATURES set already then use this line instead:
   QMAKEFEATURES=/path/to/kdtools/mkspecs/features
   export QMAKEFEATURES

   The above goes into your .bashrc or similar.
   
   Note: On Mac, you have to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3) Next compile everything by typing:
  make
  make install
 
4) In the directory examples, you will find some example programs showing the content of this package.

5) In the directory "doc" you will find a manual and a reference manual as HTML

6) If you want to be able to

This describes how to compile KD Tools from source on Windows:

1) Configure the library
   
   Make sure, that the qmake executable can be found in the path. Otherwise,
   set QTDIR by doing:
   set QTDIR=C:\path\to\qt

   Run the configure script:
   configure.bat

   If you want KD Tools installed in a non-default localtion, add:
   -prefix C:\path\to\kdtools (defaults to C:\KDTools-<version>)

   To install the plugins in a non-default location, add:
   -plugins-prefix C:\path\to\plugins (defaults to $QTDIR\plugins)

   If you want your library to contain debug symbols, add:
   -debug

   To compile KD Tools as static library, add:
   -static

   Other options can be seen with configure.bat -h

2) Setup PATH to point to the lib directory.
   set PATH=C:\path\to\kdtools\lib;%PATH%

   If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line instead:
   set PATH=C:\path\to\kdtools\lib

   Setup QMAKEFEATURES to point to the KD Tools features file:
   set QMAKEFEATURES=C:\path\to\kdtools\mkspecs\features;$QMAKEFEATURES

   If you do not have QMAKEFEATURES set already then use this line instead:
   set QMAKEFEATURES=C:\path\to\kdtools\mkspecs\features

   The above goes into your system settings or similar.
   
3) Next compile everything by typing:
  make (or nmake, on MSVC++)
  make install (or nmake install, onn MSVC++)

4) In the directory examples, you will find some example programs showing the content of this package.

5) In the directory "doc" you will find a manual and a reference manual as HTML
